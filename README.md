Hello! This is the git repository for my [neocities](https://neocities.org/) [website](https://arlynnschtuttenbach.neocities.org/). Any features that are work-in-progress can be found here. Specifically, in the branches that are ahead of [main](https://github.com/arlynnschtuttenbach/neocities/tree/main). The [main](https://github.com/arlynnschtuttenbach/neocities/tree/main) branch is where the website is auto-deployed from, using [deploy-to-neocities](https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities).
