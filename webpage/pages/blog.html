            I spent some time today exploring some of the websites on neocities. Through this, I disovered the 88x31 button concept, which I really like. At some point I'll make one for this website. As a side note, I've decided I'll be making modifications to this blog page on a specific branch in the repo. Usually, I'll make a new branch for a change and merge it back into main, never to use the branch again. But, I want to give this a shot, especially since the blog page is independent from the rest of the site (at the moment that is).
            <br><br>
            To spice this site up, I think I'm going to make some music for it. I'll probably use <a href="https://milkytracker.org/">MilkyTracker</a>, as I've been wanting to explore using a tracker for some time now. In the past, I messed around with <a href="https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/">Fruity Loops Studio</a>, but attempting to set that up on Linux seems like a pain. And frankly, I want to try something new.
            <br><br>
            Also, I think I've found a palette I like, which I began using at <a href="https://github.com/arlynnschtuttenbach/neocities/commit/dc71cdf552fdac0f6018bf18e9c4b7a9197555ac">this</a> commit. It is here that I also discovered that you can set variables in CSS using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">custom properties</a>. Also (I think I use this word too much), I need to make a better home button. Something more visually pleasing, not a hyper-link.
