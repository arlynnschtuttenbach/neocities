            <p>Hello world! I decided to create <a href="https://github.com/arlynnschtuttenbach/neocities">this</a> website out of an interest to start a blog of sorts. I'll also be using this a place to gush about my interests. Additionally, as a place to note my thoughts on more serious issues.</p>

            &emsp;I suppose I'll put a summary of myself here. My interests are pretty nerdy--programming, science, video games, and anime to name a few. Recently, I've been getting into physics, though I don't have much of a background in it. My journey as a programmer started about 7 years ago; although, it has only been a serious interest for last 5 years. Video games are mostly an on and off thing for me at this point. I used to be really into more competitive PVP games, but recently I've been taking it more casually. Anime used to be something I binged watched all of the time, but I've been wanting to get back into it.

            &emsp;For the sake of my sanity, I'll be using this website to accomplish three main goals. The first is as an anonymous way to start writing publicly (and to push myself to write to begin with). Second, is to use it as a place to put my thoughts on serious matters--this will be a decent amount of opinion. Lastly, as a place to explore and expand my interests.

            &emsp;I'm using git as the version control for this website. The repository is hosted on GitHub. You can find the link to it at the top of the page. I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities">deploy-to-neocities</a> GitHub action for deployment. Only pushes to the main branch will deploy, but you can see the other branches if you're interested. Presently, I'm not using JavaScript and will be avoiding at. Frankly, it sucks. I might see about using Java. Maybe it is possible to use <a href="https://vaadin.com/">Vaadin</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;Yes, I know this website is pretty boring to look at. I might spice things up on some of the pages. But, I definitely prefer a "clean" look to things (not like this is clean either, but that's the goal). This palette sure will be changing a bunch though.
